-ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Pankaj Mahto â€” a passionate UI/UX Designer and B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student at Cambridge Institute of Technology. With a strong foundation in UI/UX design and hands-on experience from a 4-week internship at BIT Mesra, I specialize in Figma and have worked on projects ranging from e-commerce platforms to custom app UIs, always striving for visually compelling and user-friendly designs.

ðŸš€ Currently, I'm expanding my skills in AI and chatbot development with a focus on creating tools for mental health support. Exploring new technology for positive impact drives my curiosity and commitment to continuous learning.

ðŸ“· Outside of tech, I'm passionate about drone photography, video editing, and capturing cinematic travel moments.
